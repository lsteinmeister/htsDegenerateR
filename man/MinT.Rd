  residual,
  covariance = c("shr", "sam"),
  nonnegative = FALSE,
  algorithms = c("chol", "lu", "cg"),

\arguments{
\item{fcasts}{Matrix of forecasts for all levels of a hierarchical or grouped time series. Each row represents one forecast horizon and each column represents one time series of aggregated or disaggregated forecasts.}

\item{Smat}{Summation matrix specifying the hierarchichal structure of the time series (see Hyndman et al. (2018)).}

\item{residual}{Time series or list of in-sample residuals.}

\item{covariance}{Type of the covariance matrix to be used. Shrinking towards a diagonal unequal variances ("shr") or sample covariance matrix ("sam").}

\item{nonnegative}{Not yet implemented. Only supports "False".}

\item{algorithms}{Algorithm used to compute inverse of the matrices.}

\item{keep}{Should all reconciled forecasts ("all") or only the bottom level ("bottom") be returnd.}

\item{parallel}{should this be run in parallel}

\item{num.cores}{number of cores}

\item{control.nn}{extra control arguments}

\item{cov.type}{type of covariance to be calculated ("complete.obs","pairwise.complete.obs")}
}
