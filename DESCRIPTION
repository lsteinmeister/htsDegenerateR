Description: Takes the MinT implementation of [hts: Hierarchical and Grouped Time Series]<https://cran.r-project.org/package=hts> and adapts it to allow degenerate hierarchical structures. Instead of the "nodes" argument, this function takes an S matrix which is more versatile in the structures it allows. For a demo, see [Degenerate Hierarchical Time Series Reconciliation With The Minimum Trace Algorithm in R]<doi:10.15488/17729>. The MinT algorithm is based on [Optimal Forecast Reconciliation for Hierarchical and Grouped Time Series Through Trace Minimization]<doi:10.1080/01621459.2018.1448825>.
